        <p>The story of Piazza's Parlour starts with the City of Enterprise TSA chapter. It is one of the best in Alabama, and is proud to represent TSA and all it stands for. In 2025 we decided to create a resturant that did would capture the essence of TSA. And so we decided to create a cruelty free treat that anyone, from any walk of life could enjoy, without sacrificing quality. On March 31st, we opened our parlour on 123 Mainstreet, Enterprise Alabama, and have been sharing joy since.</p>
